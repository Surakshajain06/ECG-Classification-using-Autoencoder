# 🫀 ECG Signal Classification Using Autoencoder Features

## 🧠 Problem Statement

We aim to detect **abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias)** from **ECG signals** using machine learning.

An **ECG (Electrocardiogram)** is like a heartbeat pattern. By analyzing the shape of each beat, we can determine whether it’s **normal** or **abnormal**. Automating this task can aid in faster, more consistent diagnosis of cardiac conditions.

---

## 🚧 Why Is This Problem Challenging?

- ECG signals are **long** and **complex**.
- They contain **noise**, **variability** between individuals, and **subtle abnormalities**.
- Raw ECG data is **high-dimensional**, making it difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms to handle effectively.

## 💡 Solution Strategy: Autoencoder + Classifier

### ✅ Step 1: Compressing the ECG with an Autoencoder

We use a **1D convolutional autoencoder** to learn and compress heartbeat signals.  
The autoencoder learns what a typical heartbeat looks like and **captures its essence** in a short vector (called **bottleneck features**).

> 🧠 Think of it like a doctor who learns what a normal heartbeat should look like — and focuses only on that.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Classifying the Compressed Beats

We treat the bottleneck features as a **summary** of each heartbeat.

Then, we feed these summaries to traditional classifiers like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** to determine whether each beat is **normal** or **abnormal**.

---

## 🎯 Why This Works

- The **autoencoder removes noise** and irrelevant data.
- It creates **compact, meaningful features** that classifiers can learn from easily.
- This is **more efficient** than working directly with raw ECG waveforms.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Plan

At the end, we compare two approaches:

1. Classifying beats using **autoencoder features**
2. Classifying beats using **raw ECG signal segments**

If the first approach performs **better or similarly with fewer features**, we prove the **autoencoder is effective** at learning useful heartbeat representations.

---

## 🟩 Final Summary

You're teaching a model to:

1. **Understand what a heartbeat looks like** by compressing it using an autoencoder.
2. **Use that understanding to classify beats** as normal or abnormal using a machine learning classifier.

### 🔁 Analogy

- **Autoencoder = Eye of a doctor**  
- **Classifier = Judgment of a doctor**

Together, they create an intelligent system for detecting heart problems automatically. ❤️‍🩹
